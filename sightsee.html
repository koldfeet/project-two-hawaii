                    <p>
                      Haʻikū Stairs, aka Stairway to Heaven, is one of the most Instagrammed trails on Oʻahu—even though
                      it’s been closed
                      (read: off-limits) since 1987. (Though you’d never know that from social media!)
                      So Honolulu officials decided it was enough.
                      Yesterday Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said he plans to move forward with removing the
                      controversial stairs,
                      which have been breached by trespassing hikers—and upsetting residents in the area—for decades.

                      If there‘s one thing park rangers do best is give advice.
                      And the friendly—and knowledgeable—rangers at Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park on Hawaiʻi
                      Island have put together a list of tips for anyone planning a trip to its sprawling 333,308-acre
                      park.
                      Here’s how you can plan like a ranger—and trust us, you may want to bookmark this.
                      “Start your visit at 5 a.m. or 5 p.m. to maximize the experience, and minimize the crowds,” says
                      park ranger Ben Hayes. “Start off with an unforgettable sunrise, and plan a full day ahead. A 5
                      p.m.
                      arrival allows two-plus hours for hiking in the cool evening, followed by sunset,” Hayes said. The
                      park is
                      open 24 hours a day.

                    <p>
                      The popular Maunawili Falls Trail, a 2.8-mile trek to a swimming hole in Windward Oʻahu, will be
                      closed for two years starting on July 15.
                      The state is planning major improvements to the trail, which starts in the quiet Maunawili Estate
                      subdivision, which has been inundated
                      with hikers in recent years. Residents have long complained about people parking in their
                      driveways, using their garden hoses without
                      permission and leaving trash on roads and in yards.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      It was my first trip to Kauaʻi—to anywhere—since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020,
                      and I wanted to do everything.
                      Lounge on Hanalei Beach.
                      Drink mai tais at Tahiti Nui.
                      See the Nāpali Coast by boat.
                      Eat kūlolo.
                      And trek to a secret waterfall somewhere on this ridiculously lush and gorgeous island.
                      So that’s what I did.
                      Hidden in the back of the Wailua River on Kauaʻi, Uluwehi Falls is hardly a secret anymore.
                      But it is only accessibly by boat, then on foot, making it a difficult waterfall to get to. And I
                      was going to get there.
                      Since I didn’t pack a kayak in my carry-on, I needed to book a guided tour to the falls. Rainbow
                      Kayak Tours offers a
                      4 1/2-hour kayaking and hiking adventure that would get me to the 120-foot waterfall—and with
                      lunch.
                    </p>

                        This View of Kīlauea Volcano From Uēkahuna Bluff</a>
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      The view from Uēkahuna, the highest point on the rim of Kaluapele, the caldera of Kīlauea, is
                      unlike any other—and the popular bluff has
                      reopened this week after being closed since 2018.
                      That year, magma drained from Halemaʻumaʻu, the summit crater, triggering months of repetitive
                      earthquakes, damaging ash clouds and
                      the eventual collapse of Kīlauea summit. This unprecedented eruption caused major damage to roads,
                      hiking trails and park buildings
                      within Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park. Uēkahuna had to be closed for repairs.
                      Now, from this cliff top, you can see evidence of that destructive eruption, from the newly
                      exposed yellow sulfur bank to the gaping
                      chasm that is now Halemaʻumaʻu. On a clear day, you can see the slopes of Mauna Loa.
