            Imagine a miles-long beach with sand as soft as powder and stunning turquoise water as far as the eye can
            see. If you’re planning a trip to Oahu, you won’t have to! Waimanalo Beach is a true hidden gem on this
            popular
            island, though many visitors never make it there.Waimanalo has two main entrances, one near the south end
            across from Nakini Street and another on the north end between Aloiloi Street and Tinker Road. The former
            is
            considered the official Waimanalo Beach Park while the latter is technically called Waimanalo Bay State
            Recreation Area.
            Both spots come complete with showers, restrooms, a lifeguard tower, trash cans, picnic tables, and
            campsites
            available.

            Located on the south shore of Honolulu, the world-famous neighborhood of Waikiki was once a playground for
            Hawaiian royalty. Known in Hawaiian as "spouting waters," Waikiki was introduced to the world when its
            first
            hotel, the Moana Surfrider, was built on its shores in 1901. Today, Waikiki is Oahu’s main hotel and
            resort area and
            a vibrant gathering place for visitors from around the world. Along the main strip of Kalakaua Avenue
            you'll
            find world-class shopping, dining, entertainment, activities and resorts.

            In 2002 a marine education center was opened for visitors and part of the conservation plan requires
            first-time visitors to watch a 9 minute video before entering the park so they can learn about the
            marine life, preservation and safety rules for the park. All visitors are required by law to refrain
            from mistreating the marine animals and from touching or walking on the coral. In the early 2000’s the
            natural spa called “Toilet Bowl” because of the rise and fall of water with the waves, was closed to
            visitors due safety concerns.

            The Ka’iwa Ridge Trail, otherwise known as the Pillbox Trail, is located on the ridge overlooking Lanikai
            and Enchanted Lakes, both suburbs of Kailua on the windward side of Oahu. Lanikai was once an agricultural
            area with fields of watermelon, but later the area became secluded weekend vacation homesteads for the
            wealthy
            to escape from Honolulu. The beauty of Lanikai beach and Lanikai Bay with it’s close proximity to the
            offshore
            islands (the Mokes) has turned Lanikai into a place of great renown over time. This trail has become one
            of
            the
            most popular trails on the island because of the stunning views of Kailua Bay, Ko’olau Mountains,
            ease of accessibility, and length of hike. A recent survey showed 1,370 visitors in one day!

            More commonly known as Turtle Beach, this Oahu North Shore cove often attracts honu, aka Chelonia mydas,
            the largest of the hard-shelled sea turtles. These big, friendly giants can reach 400 pounds as adults
            and are herbivorous, feeding primarily on algae and seagrasses, abundant year-round in the warm,
            shallow waters. Summer's gentle surf—swells averaging just two feet—increase your odds of quality turtle
            time.
            Cross the road carefully and keep at least six feet away from the endangered turtles as they sunbathe
            onshore
            (mind any "no-go" zones maintained by volunteers). Avoid swimming here: The currents and beach rocks make
            it
            challenging.
